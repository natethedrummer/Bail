Solution
Working with Dr. Wheeler at Themis Research to sift through Harris County arrest records and identify factors that drive access to bail.  Dr. Wheeler has provided me data and asked me questions to investigate.  I use machine learning and data visualization to answer Dr. Wheeler's questions and illustrate my findings.
