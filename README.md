# Harris County Bail Research

## Problem  
Bail practices across the United States are unsafe, unfair, and ineffective.  Poor people are locked up while rich people pay to get out of jail. This is a timely issue.  [Courts are deciding](http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/harris-county-case-end-cash-bail-know/ "Article") whether Harris County bail practices are unconstitutional. 

## Solution  
Working with Dr. Wheeler at [Themis Research](http://themisresearch.org/ "Themis Research") to sift through Harris County arrest records and identify factors that drive access to bail.  Dr. Wheeler has provided me data and asked me questions to investigate.  I use machine learning and data visualization to answer Dr. Wheeler's questions and illustrate my findings.

## This Repository  
This repo contains the data, Python code, and charts I've used to prove that Harris County bail practices are unconstitutionally discriminating against defendants with low income.  

## Next Steps  
I want to find more people who need help proving that the bail system is discriminating against defendants based on income.  I have decent data science skills, but I need to get more data and get access to the right people who have the power to enact bail reform.
